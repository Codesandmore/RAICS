    Brief Overview <br>
    <br>
    What is oneAPI?<br>
    <br>
    oneAPI is an open, standards-based, unified cross-architecture programming model
    that provides developers the freedom to choose the best hardware (CPU, GPU and
    FPGAs) for accelerated computing. oneAPI delivers performance without proprietary
    lock-in while interoperating with code written in familiar standards including C,
    C++, SYCL, Fortran, Python, MPI and OpenMP.With oneAPI, developers can choose the
    best architecture for their specific problem without needing to completely rewrite
    software for the next architecture and platform. <br>
    <br>
    Intel®️ oneAPI Toolkits– Are built on Intel’s rich heritage of proven CPU developer
    tools now expanded for XPUs; they support familiar languages and standards while
    providing full interoperability with existing code. The toolkits deliver on the
    performance potential of Intel®️ architectures and lower software development and
    maintenance costs. oneAPI and Intel oneAPI Toolkits together bring productive and
    performant heterogenous programming to developers. <br>
    <br>
    Intel Developer Cloud – It is a sandbox enabling the users to wonderful stuff with
    amount of facilities and guidelines it provides. Access to the Intel Developer Cloud
    can be introduced for the participants and they can learn Machine learning, GenAI
    and SYCL (HPC) through the Intel Developer Cloud.`,

    <b>Cloud</b> 
    <br><br>
    Cloud computing revolutionizes the way businesses manage and deliver IT resources over the internet. Instead of owning physical hardware and managing on-premises data centers, organizations can access computing power, storage, and other services on-demand from cloud providers. Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands out as a leading cloud platform, offering a vast array of services such as computing power with Amazon EC2, scalable storage with Amazon S3, and managed databases with Amazon RDS. AWS enables businesses to innovate rapidly, scale seamlessly, and reduce costs by paying only for the resources they consume. With its global reach and robust security features, AWS empowers businesses of all sizes to build and deploy applications with agility and efficiency in today's digital landscape.`,

    "Evolution of Cellular Networks Beyond 5G: Requirements and Enabling Technologies",
    `The evolution of cellular technologies has been remarkable with each generation pushing the boundaries of connectivity and communication. With the rapid deployment and adoption of 5G worldwide, attention is gradually shifting towards what lies beyond. While it may be too early to specify the requirements, the next generation of cellular networks is expected to provide ultra-high data rates, ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, security, and privacy. From the Shannon fundamental limit of communication, we try to understand how the different enabling technologies try to fulfill these requirements. As a key enabling technology, cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output shall be discussed along with some perspectives on the future of cellular communication.
